## CIS3301-CODE-17-The-Bank-Object

## Instructions

As we start the object oriented programming module, you are asked to create a simple Python object that simulates a Bank. Your object should have the following methods (functions inside the class):

* deposit()
  * This method that receives the amount of money to deposit as an argument and adds the money to the account.
  * The method does not returns anything but prints out if the transaction was succesful.
* withdraw()
  * This method that receives the amount of money to withdraw and substracts the amount to the account.
  * The method should not allow the user to withdraw money that does not exist in the account.
  * The method does not returns anything but prints out if the transaction was succesful and the remaining balance in the account.
* print_balance()
  * This method prints out the balance. It does not return the balance.

**Note:** That all the methods implement void-like functions.

After you create your code, show that your code is working with at least 5 transactions.
